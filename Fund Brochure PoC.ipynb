       "\n",
       "## Performance\n",
       "Performance data for the fund is not specified in the provided materials, but as with any mutual fund, it’s typically benchmarked against similar funds and market indices to measure effectiveness. Investors are encouraged to review historical performance metrics and trends for better insights into growth trajectories.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Fees\n",
       "As a no-load fund, the Kinetics Global No Load Class Fund does not impose sales charges. However, ongoing management and operational fees may apply and can affect the overall returns. It is advisable to review the fund’s prospectus for detailed fee structures and potential expenses.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Expected Returns\n",
       "Again, while specific expected returns are not provided, investors can generally look to long-term equity markets for guidance. Historical performance and market trends provide a context for understanding potential returns, though individual results may vary based on market conditions.\n",
